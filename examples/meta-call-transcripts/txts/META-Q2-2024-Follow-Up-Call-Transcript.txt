Michael Nathanson: Thanks. I just have two quick ones on cost view. In your answer on
employee headcount growth, you talk about a ramp in employee hiring. We've
already seen that come through the past couple quarters. Anyway, can you
help us frame how you think about the normal level of headcount growth from
this point on?
And then we talk about meaningful expansion of losses at Reality Labs. What
are the factors that would contribute to that maybe change in the run rate
we've seen? Is depreciation a factor as you increase CapEx? Anything on the
factors driving Reality Lab losses would be helpful. Thanks.
Susan Li:

Thanks, Michael. On your first question -- coming into this year, we talked
about how we were basically working through a hiring underrun that was a
result of a prolonged hiring freeze that we had last year.
And so that is the bulk of what you're seeing the hiring that has happened in
2024 represent. so basically working through the hiring underrun is where the
majority of hiring is going now. We aren't giving guidance for 2025, in part
because we haven't started our budget, but generally, our approach towards
headcount allocation is to really be taking a pretty ruthless look at, what places
we can we shift resources from -- areas that are sort of no longer particularly
critical or high priority, to the highest priority areas going into 2025.
So, I expect that we will be very focused in the parts of the company that are
growing heads, and I expect we'll be pretty disciplined about the longer-term
headcount trajectory.
On your second question, we haven't updated any of the guidance on Reality
Labs. I think we reiterated the prior guidance on Reality Labs. So, I don't think
I said anything about a change in run rate. Our expectations for Reality Labs, of
course encompass the full set of ambitions in the area, both our work in MR, in
AR, in the Metaverse.
So we are investing really across a pretty broad array of efforts there. Within
that envelope, we are certainly seeing that we are shifting some energy
towards AR glasses in particular. I think the traction that we have seen with
the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and the product market fit and demand for the
product out of the market, and the overlap with our AI efforts where the
glasses form factor is really such an intuitive way to bring an AI assistant with
you around that sees what you see and hears what you hear. So, we're
definitely trying to accelerate our glasses efforts in the Reality Lab space.

Your next question comes from the line of James Lee with Mizuho. Please go
ahead.

James Lee:

Great. Thanks for taking my questions here. Susan, when you look at search
results on Meta AI, does that help you maybe improve commercial intent and
relevancy for your ad targeting? For example, I was thinking of maybe travel,
people searching for travel, people searching for local advertising, maybe
looking for a gym nearby.
And secondly, and just to double-click on your prior statement about investing
ahead, but we'll also offset by increased efficiency, maybe help us understand
that approach a little bit. This approach here is to neutralize maybe high
depreciation expenses with high efficiency? Can you help us understand where
you are looking within the organization to lower your cost base? Thank you.

Susan Li:

Thanks, James. So, in terms of, the types of queries that we're seeing on Meta
AI, we're seeing early signs that Meta AI is helping people leverage our apps for
a range of new use cases. We see that a lot of people are using Meta AI for
learning and information gathering type use cases, things like how-to advice,
knowledge-based questions, writing assistance. We're also seeing a large
number of people find value in using Meta AI for coaching.
So, there's a range of queries. We're pretty early in the journey with Meta AI
and I think that, over the coming quarters, we are going to continue to iterate
on it. We're going to broaden availability to new languages and countries and
that's going to help us. We're going to ship new features and improvements,
and that's going to help us make the Meta AI experience increasingly rich and
engaging for people, which is really where our primary focus is right now.
On the second question about headcount -- being disciplined about the way
that we are thinking about allocating headcount. This is a place where we are
really trying to be very disciplined and ruthless about the way we are
prioritizing in here, in part because it allows us to invest in infrastructure, which
is just such a critical part of our AI ambitions right now.

Operator:

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.
Please go ahead.

Ken Gawrelski:

Thank you. Hi, Susan. Two questions, please. First, on the growth mix, it
shifted more to pricing from just from impression growth. How should we
think about the balance between impression growth and pricing going forward
and what does that mean for '25 and '26 growth drivers? Are you looking to
achieve some kind of balance there?
3

And then maybe on the second, and this is more kind of an ecosystem question
on the AI side, is how far in Meta's view are we away from seeing a proliferation
of third-party AI applications? We've seen some select AI applications mostly
from the largest scale spenders today, but when do we see the ecosystem
flourish like we did with mobile internet or desktop internet? Is this an element
of time or is it capabilities on the model side? Thanks.
Susan Li:

Thanks, Ken. Taking your question in pieces. So, on the first question, the
trends in impression growth and price per ad growth are somewhat related
because we are operating an auction.
So, the year-over-year growth in reported price per ad may have accelerated
from Q1, but there's a lot that goes into that, not least of which are the auction
dynamics that come from impression growth slowing down from Q1.
Now one thing we keep a close eye on in order to understand the value that
advertisers are getting from their ads is the average cost per action, and that is
a complex metric for us because there are many different objectives that
advertisers optimize for and those different objectives can have quite different
values depending on whether it's an app install or a web conversion, et cetera.
But overall, we feel good about the cost per action trends we're seeing. We
think that those are healthy. And as we continue to get better at driving
conversions for advertisers, that will have the effect of lifting price per
impression over time because we're delivering more conversions per
impression served, meaning the impressions are higher value, which is the way
that I would frame it as opposed to impressions getting more expensive.
And ultimately, driving conversions for advertisers is really what we are trying
to do as opposed to, for example, optimize for a particular price or just drive
impressions independently of conversions.
On the second question, which is about the proliferation of third-party AI
applications and when that will happen. It's clearly, I think, very early in the
development of that ecosystem. But as Mark said, the pace of capability
development is really what is getting ourselves and our peers excited, and just
the pace at which the models are advancing and then our ability to build on
those to create good tools for creators.
And so, we announced that we're rolling out AI Studio in the U.S. That enables
people to create AI characters which are fully customizable and conversational
Ais. You can do it from a template, you can do it from scratch based on your
4

personal interests. And then Creator AIs are extension of characters and
creators can build an AI within Instagram or on the web that can answer
common DM type questions and Story replies and they can use that to connect
with their followers.
So, we're excited about the opportunity for both of those to become really
useful features and for a healthy and active Creator AI ecosystem to flourish on
top of the tools that we are building.
Operator:

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon with New Street
Research. Please go ahead.

Daniel Salmon:

Okay, great. Good afternoon, everyone. Susan, your outlook comments
obviously emphasize the growth of infrastructure-related costs in 2025. Could
you add a little bit of color on how that might impact different expense lines?
We assume that's mostly in cost of revenue, but maybe there's some in R&D as
well.
And then any color on the balance of depreciation versus cash expenses that
you can add? Just love to hear any more that can help us out with the models
tonight.

Susan Li:

Thank you, Dan, for the question. So, as it pertains to CapEx, one of the things I
want to be really clear about is we have seen significant growth this year in
CapEx. We expect another year of significant growth in 2025. And, we are not
in a position to quantify this yet, as I mentioned on the call, in part because the
infrastructure planning process is -- it's very dynamic.
In fact, when you are trying to build large training clusters and to land the
capacity that you need, you often end up spinning up multiple projects and
parallel pathing multiple options because there are many reasons why one
option or another will end up not becoming feasible in the process of trying to
build capacity.
So, for us, a lot of the uncertainty in 2025 comes around evaluating those
parallel paths and the fact that there's a lot of uncertainty about how each
individual path may pan out. But, again, we think, in all cases that we expect
that 2025 will be another year of significant CapEx growth.
Now, to the specific question about how it might impact expense lines. It is
both in cost of revenue and R&D. The expenses that flow through R&D really
capture the depreciation and operating expenses of the infrastructure that is
used to support AI research across the company. And then the expenses that
5

flow through cost of revenue really are more around supporting the sort of core
ads ranking and recommendation use cases.
We haven't really commented on the mix of depreciation versus cash expenses
next year. Obviously, depreciation is from the footprint that we've already built
flowing through but we are also commencing new projects in '25 that will
require cash outlays and then we'll end up depreciating through future year
P&Ls.
Operator:

Your next question comes from the line of Rob Sanderson with Loop Capital
Markets. Please go ahead.

Rob Sanderson:

Yes, thank you. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back and revisit
commentary you shared last quarter, or Mark was sharing last quarter, just on
the discussion for potential of revenue displacement as you invest in scaling up
GenAI products. And I think the general interpretation was this was maybe a
shift in AI capacity away from core AI into strategic AI, obviously core AI driving
monetization today, GenAI, no near-term monetization.
So, first, is that the correct interpretation? And if so, are you talking about a
shift of allocation of new capacity or are we actually shifting some capacity
away from core?
And then second on that is, does the decision to delay training in the EU
provide any relief on capacity demands?

Susan Li:

Thanks, Rob. So, on the first question, clarifying the comments from last
quarter. Our compute needs outstrip our available data center capacity right
now. Given the focus that we have on accelerating our GenAI efforts, the new
capacity that we've been bringing online is really going more towards GenAI
than towards other workloads.
We've also had to do a little bit of shifting capacity around to free up capacity
for GenAI training. And altogether, we expect that that will result in some
foregone revenue growth from ads and organic content ranking improvements
that we would have otherwise made, but that has been factored into our Q3
outlook. And we generally expect this to be to be a near term dynamic until we
start bringing additional data center capacity online next year, which will meet
our capacity needs.
On your second question around the EU, we're working with regulators to
address their concerns, so we can develop and improve our AI products based
on the information that people choose to share on our platforms. I would say,
6

generally, I would expect training capacity to be a big driver of future CapEx
needs. I think that will be the case, regardless of how things progress in
Europe.
Operator:

Your next question comes from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Wolfe
Research. Please go ahead.

Shweta Khajuria: Thank you for taking my question. I guess I just wanted to ask about how -- if it
is fair to think of the return, and you've been asked this question many different
ways, but if we think about the incremental revenue that's generated, expected
to generate, call it next year or this year versus prior years, and the
incrementality that we see attributed to AI, is that a good way of thinking
about the contribution of AI, or the return from your AI investments? Thank
you.
Susan Li:

Thanks, Shweta. I'm going to do my best to answer this question and let me
know if I didn't address the heart of it.
So, the incremental revenue that you see this year and largely next year,
coming from the ads business, that will primarily be a function of the
investments that we have been making in the core AI work that goes into the
ongoing ads performance improvements as we make our ranking, delivery,
targeting, et cetera systems, more performant over time.
We are certainly investing in core AI as a part of the infrastructure growth next
year. At the same time, a lot of the CapEx that we are building next year is in
service of training foundation models for our GenAI efforts, where we are really
much earlier, and we don't expect that to be a meaningful driver of revenue in
'24 or '25.
But we expect that they will open up revenue opportunities in the future and
we've talked about some of those -- making the core ads business better by
making ads increasingly personalized at scale, growing business messaging,
particularly in developed markets, obviously monetizing the consumer
experience that we hope to build with Meta AI, and then also making it easier to
create content for core organic engagement. But again, those I think will all
play out over a longer period of time.

Shweta Khajuria: Okay, thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with UBS. Please go
ahead.

Stephen Ju:

Hi Susan. So, I was pleasantly surprised to hear you talk about games and
entertainment sectors as being one of the larger contributors to your growth
here, and I think this is a sector that's seen some tough times post-pandemic
and even post-IDFA deprecation. So, what's changed from a product
perspective that you've been able to revitalize spending from that segment?
And digging in a little bit in terms of your commentary from the APAC-based
advertisers and what they're doing. I think a couple of quarters ago, you gave
us all a sort of food for thought to really think beyond a larger e-commerce
platform. So, can you update us on the makeup of these advertisers and
whether the audience they are targeting has evolved over time? Thanks.

Chad Heaton:

This is Chad. I can start with your first question. I'll start broadly about
verticals. We saw a continued healthy year-over-year growth across verticals
in Q2. We mentioned that came from online commerce, gaming, and
entertainment and media. But the rate of growth did come down relative to Q1
across pretty much all the verticals.
In terms of gaming specifically, as I said, year-over-year growth remains strong
but decelerated in Q2. That was primarily driven by slower growth among
China-based advertisers. We don't have anything more specific in terms of
products or features that launched. Again, more recently, it has been a vertical
that we've seen strength in. And we saw strength again in Q2.

Susan Li:

On your second question, Stephen, we shared previously that two-thirds of our
China ad revenue came from advertisers outside the top 10 spenders in China
in 2023. I think that's the comment that you're referring to.
We don't have an update on that for this year, but I would say it continues to be
a diverse advertiser base. And more broadly, I think we are continuing to see a
longer-term trend of growth from China-based advertisers.
Again, there's obviously variability in growth rates period to period. There was
clearly an impact, from COVID, but I think it's been over the last several years a
strong contributor to growth for us and we expect it to remain so. And again,
most of our China-based ad revenue continues to come from a longer tail of
advertisers.

Operator:

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz with The
Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.

Mark Zgutowicz:

Thank you. Susan, two quick ones if I could. On the CapEx side of things, I'm
just curious if you would contemplate managing free cash flow in the negative
8

growth territory next year to fulfill another big step up you've discussed in
terms of investment?
And then just a clarification on Reels inventory growth. You mentioned a
higher conversion of Reels ad units which would suggest lower growth in ad
load here just going forward. But if you could just maybe balance that with a
comment on just short video in general offering more inventory units to sell, I
guess whatâ€™s the messaging here in terms of next 12 months, if you will, growth
in ad units here with Reels versus the last 12 months? Just trying to get, I
guess, a picture there. Thanks.
Susan Li:

Thanks, Mark. Iâ€™ll take that first question. We havenâ€™t really guided on free
cash flow. Again, I would say there is a big range of CapEx outcomes that weâ€™re
working through right now based on different data center options in different
places. So, I think thereâ€™s a lot going on. Itâ€™s really a very dynamic planning area
for us right now and weâ€™ll have more clarity on that at the Q4 call.

Chad Heaton:

So, in terms of Reels inventory growth, I guess speaking broadly, we are in a
period where say last year, we ramped Reels ad load pretty significantly. And
so, we certainly donâ€™t have opportunities in front of us to continue to increase
ad load at that rate.
I would say at this point, with respect to Reels, weâ€™re focusing on optimizing
the level of ads just by launching and testing new experiences for ads to deliver
in Reels. One example of that would be back-to-back ads in Reels where in Q2
we started showing some ads more closely together in Instagram Reels,
including back-to-back when we have more relevant and engaging ads to show.
Weâ€™re also, over on the Facebook side, weâ€™re focused on video unification,
where Facebook has a lot longer form video that monetizes at a lower rate than
short form. And so, we expect that mix of video shift more to short form over
time as part of that video unification works, which should benefit monetization
efficiency of a video on Facebook.
So, we have a lower ad load still on Reels than we do, say, in Feed and Stories.
There are opportunities there as we look forward. But I wouldnâ€™t expect them
to be growing at the rate that they have historically.

Operator:

Your next question comes from the line Richard Greenfield with Lightshed.
Please go ahead.

Richard Greenfield:
Hi, thanks for taking the question. You havenâ€™t updated us on number of
advertisers in a long time. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re comfortable. I think the last
9

time it was like 12 million. But regardless of what the actual number is, I
wanted to just hone in on Markâ€™s commentary around the impact of AI to help
advertisers make content.
Obviously, video ads with AI isnâ€™t ready yet. But Iâ€™m sure over the next 12 or 18
months it will be. Is there any way you can give us a sense of how many of -what percentage even, of Metaâ€™s advertisers today actually make video ads
versus just static images or text? Just trying to understand how much it could
change the amount of advertisers and suppliers into your advertising funnel
over the course of the next couple of years. Or anyway of thinking about that
question or topic. Thanks.
Susan Li:

Thanks, Rich. We have not updated this, as you mentioned, and I donâ€™t think
weâ€™re sharing the number of advertisers who create video ads. Having said
that, I would emphasize Markâ€™s comments that we are really evolving our ads
products and features to make it easier for advertisers to use a lot of the new
GenAI-powered features that weâ€™re building.
Weâ€™ve been very pleased with the reception of our GenAI ad creative tools so
far, weâ€™ve seen good usage retention, performance games, even at the stage
we are today, which is very early, over a million advertisers actually used either
image expansion, background generation, or text variation in the past month,
and weâ€™re seeing particularly strong adoption of our image expansion feature,
especially among smaller online commerce advertisers. And weâ€™re seeing,
again, improved performance gains from advertisers who are using these.
So we are focused on continuing to expand the capabilities of our existing
creative generation tools in the future. We want to introduce more interactive
features to help advertisers fine-tune images that they generate through text
prompts, for example. We want to make it easier to incorporate brand input
and to allow advertisers to optimize the ad creatives based on what advertisers
feel makes the ads unique to their brand, so working with them to better tailor
their image and text generation capabilities to brand colors, logos, that sort of
thing, and adding new formats.
So weâ€™re very early here, I think there is a lot of work that weâ€™ll be undertaking
over the next years, frankly, to make it easier for advertisers to continue
generating personalized at scale.

Kenneth Dorell:

Krista, we have time for one last question.

Operator:

Certainly. Your last question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler with
Seaport Research. Please go ahead.
10

Aaron Kessler:

Great, appreciate the last question. I had just a couple questions on the maybe
Family of Apps. think the growth slowed a little bit for the other category, just
any updates on messaging revenues, et cetera? And just any more color on the
legal costs, if you can quantify that at all, in terms of the Q2 G&A? Thank you.

Chad Heaton:

In terms of FoA growth, I think weâ€™ve saw strong growth there. In terms of
messaging specifically, click to messaging continues to be a strong area of
growth for us. I would say business messaging -- paid messaging also
continues to grow nicely for us. So I donâ€™t know that we have new stats to
share here but this continued to be a great area of growth for us in Q2.

Kenneth Dorell:

Aaron, this is Ken. The one thing I would also add is that within that segment
we are lapping a pricing change with the business messaging product in June of
last year, so we started lapping that later in the quarter, and then weâ€™re also
lapping more of the broader roll-out of Meta Verified, so thatâ€™s contributing to
the results in Q2.

Aaron Kessler:

Got it, thatâ€™s helpful. And then just anything on the legal costs?

Susan Li:

Yes, on the legal side. Our Q2 G&A expenses include the settlement with the
state of Texas, and so that has been fully accrued for. G&A expenses were
down 12% year over year since we also lapped large legal-related expenses
from the second quarter of 2023.

Kenneth Dorell:

Great. Well thank you, everyone, for joining us. We look forward to speaking to
you again soon.

Operator:

This concludes todayâ€™s conference call. Thank you for your participation and
