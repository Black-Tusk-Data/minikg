 - [X] iss-1
   - need to add 'name' to each community
   - so instead of just being a list of node names, we should use a real
     object for each community
   - names don't need to be meaningful, that isn't a requirement
     for this lib at least right now
 - [X] iss-2
   - want to support hierarchical leiden - need to compress the multi-graph
 - [ ] iss-3
   - need to support passing-in configuration for leiden

   [[/Users/liam/btd/minikg/minikg/models.py::106]] class Community(BaseModel):
   - better structure for community defs
   - it's impossible to tell if a community node is an actual node
     or another community
   - can roll in iss-1
 - [ ] iss-5
   - in Leiden, when flattened graph, sum the number of multi-edges to
     give a weight for each flattened edge
 - [ ] iss-6
   - ensure that the algorithm operates on disjoint components of the graph,
     may need to iterate over the connected components in the community detection phase
 - [ ] iss-7
   - figure out why edge 'description' s are disappearing
   - pretty sure just need to use 'G.get_edge_data'
 - [ ] iss-8
   - split up node / edge identification and description into distinct phases:
     - identification: just identify the nodes and edges (maybe using a working 'description' to help the merges)
     - topo sort
     - summarize using dependencies

* next steps
 - once you have communities with structure,
   add a 'summary' step that operates with max possible parallelism
   (likely using queue)
   to summarize each community
