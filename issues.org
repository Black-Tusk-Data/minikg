 - iss-1
   - need to add 'name' to each community
   - so instead of just being a list of node names, we should use a real
     object for each community
   - names don't need to be meaningful, that isn't a requirement
     for this lib at least right now
 - iss-2
   - want to support hierarchical leiden - need to compress the multi-graph
