 - [ ] iss-1
   - need to add 'name' to each community
   - so instead of just being a list of node names, we should use a real
     object for each community
   - names don't need to be meaningful, that isn't a requirement
     for this lib at least right now
 - [ ] iss-2
   - want to support hierarchical leiden - need to compress the multi-graph
 - [ ] iss-3
   - need to support passing-in configuration for leiden
 - [ ] iss-4
   - better structure for community defs
   - it's impossible to tell if a community node is an actual node
     or another community
   - can roll in iss-1
 - [ ] iss-5
   - in Leiden, when flattened graph, sum the number of multi-edges to
     give a weight for each flattened edge

* next steps
 - once you have communities with structure,
   add a 'summary' step that operates with max possible parallelism
   (likely using queue)
   to summarize each community
