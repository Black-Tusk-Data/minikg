   - in Leiden, when flattened graph, sum the number of multi-edges to
     give a weight for each flattened edge

   - ensure that the algorithm operates on disjoint components of the graph,
     may need to iterate over the connected components in the community detection phase
 - [ ] idea-8
   - split up node / edge identification and description into distinct phases:
     - identification: just identify the nodes and edges (maybe using a working 'description' to help the merges)
     - topo sort
     - summarize using dependencies
